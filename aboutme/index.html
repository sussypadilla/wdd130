  <h2>Sussy</h2>
  <p> Hello everyone! </p>
  <p>My name is Sussan Padilla! But all my family and friends call me Sussy.</p>
  <p>I am studying a major in Applied Teachnology at BYU-Idaho.</p>
  <p>What I like to do for fun is playing tennis, listening to music and dancing. I also like reading and learning new things every day.</p>
  <p>I’m married with three children. My family is the most important possession I have. I love my family so much. I graduated with Honors with a Bachelor's Degree in English option Teaching from the University of  El Salvador in 2018. But, I've always loved Teachnology so, I am trying to make a change by persuing my education at BYU-I.</p>
  <p> What I like about BYU-I is the encouragment, support and positive reinforcement I receive every week from the leaders of the institution and from my instructors. I’m very excited to learn more about this course of Web Fundamentals. </p>
  <p>Advantages of learning web design? I think they are many! We all know how important is Technology nowadays. In the near future, I would like to get a job as a web developer. Also, I would like someday to have my own Technology company and offer different types of services. </p>
  <p>I am LDS. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 25 years. I’m happy for having the Gospel in my life. One of my favorite quotes from one of the leaders (Thomas S. Monson) of the church is "If we never try it, we will never do it, and if we never do it, why are we here?
